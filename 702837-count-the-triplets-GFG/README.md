## Easy

Given an array arr, count the number of distinct triplets (a, b, c) such that:


a + b = c


Each triplet is counted only once, regardless of the order of a and b.



Examples: 
Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 3, 2]
Output: 2 
Explanation: There are 2 triplets: 1 + 2 = 3 and 3 +2 = 5
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4]
Output: 0
Explanation: No such triplet exits
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1031 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
