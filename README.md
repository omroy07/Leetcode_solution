## 📘 About

This repository contains a growing collection of solved **LeetCode** problems.  
Each problem is placed in its own folder with the problem number and title (e.g. `0001-two-sum`).  
Solutions are designed to be **easy to understand**, **commented**, and **interview-ready**.

**Highlights:**
- 💻 All solutions in **C++**
- 🧩 Well-structured folders by problem number & title  
- 🚀 Ideal for **coding interviews**, **DSA practice**, and **competitive programming**
- 🎯 Updated regularly as more problems are solved

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
Before running the solutions, make sure you have:
- A C++ compiler (supporting C++14/17 or higher)  
- Optional: Any IDE or code editor like **VS Code**, **CLion**, or **Code::Blocks**  
- Basic understanding of compiling and executing C++ programs


## 🧩 How to Use

### 🧠 For Learning
Study the solutions to understand various **approaches**, **algorithms**, and **time–space complexity trade-offs**.  
Each solution demonstrates clear logic and clean C++ implementation for better understanding.

---

### 💼 For Interview Prep
Practice solving problems **without viewing the solution first**.  
After finishing, compare your approach with the one here to identify **optimization opportunities** and **better patterns**.

---

### 🔁 For Revision
Quickly browse through categorized problems — such as **Arrays**, **Dynamic Programming**, **Graphs**, **Trees**, etc.  
Use it to **recap algorithms**, **logic patterns**, and **problem-solving techniques** efficiently.

---

### 🤝 For Contributions
Add your own **optimized or alternative solutions**.  
Ensure:
- The folder name follows the format `000X-problem-name`
- The code is **well-commented** and **readable**
- You include explanations if possible (optional but helpful)
